      <div id="content">Our mission at the Bergen County Horse Rescue is to rehabilitate and protect neglected horses with the assistance of local animal control officers and veterinarians.
          <br><br>
The mind, body, and soul of our horses are what we care about and strive to preserve, and it is our responsibility to provide the proper nourishment for each horse according to the horseâ€™s individual conditions and needs. We make sure this happens by implementing specific health plans and reconditioning programs that strengthen and elevate the mind, body and soul of every horse.
          <br><br>
Though various methods are used to improve horse health, the main support horses need is an environment where they can commingle and receive love and care from humans. Horses enrich the lives of many people, so our aspiration is to encourage humanity to invest some thought in these beautiful, sensitive and, unfortunately, mistreated animals.</div>
