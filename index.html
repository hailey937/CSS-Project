      <div id="content">(center) We are dedicated to the rescue and rehabilitation of neglected horses (center)
          <br><br>
Hailey's Horse Rescue was founded in 2001 with the sole purpose of helping horses in need. The rescue called upon the help of local animal control officers and veterinarians to assist in the care of our rescues. We strive to provide a safe, loving environment for our horses so they can be free to interact with each other and with our volunteers and many visitors to the farm.
          <br><br>
Horses enrich the lives of so many people. These majestic, intuitive creatures provide comfort and joy to our volunteers and visitors alike. We have witnessed the miraculous transformation of horses who arrive at our rescue from neglectful or abusive situations. Our horses receive expert medical care and plenty of love and attention from our dedicated volunteers.</div>
